##### Overview

Standard block-bootstrap methods (IID, Moving Block, Stationary Block) fail to preserve regime structure in macro-FX data and bias Sharpe inference. This project proposes two regime-aware resamplers:

- **Regime-Uniform** — resampling of entire regime blocks uniformly at random.
- **Regime-Markov** — resampling of entire regime blocks via a calibrated Markov transition matrix.

Validated against three naive baselines on three currency pairs (EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY) at B = 1999 bootstrap replicates with a BEER fair-value pricer.

**Key result:** Regime-Markov reduces the cross-pool Sharpe loss by **1.3×** over Regime-Uniform and by **4.6×** over the naive IID baseline.

##### Methodology highlights

- **Regime taxonomy:** 8 expert-defined EUR/USD macro-monetary regimes (PRE_GFC, GFC, EURO_CRISIS_ERA, TAPER_TRANSITION, NIRP_DOVISH, COVID, INFLATION_SHOCK, DISINFLATION)
- **BEER pricer:** Clark-MacDonald (1998) reduced form with FMOLS estimation and HAC standard errors
- **Bootstrap:** 5 methods compared (IID, MBB, SB, Regime-Uniform, Regime-Markov)
- **Metrics:** L0 (Sharpe loss), L1 (correlation), L2 (Wasserstein), L3 (network/spectral), L4 (temporal), arrangement (composition/transition)
- **Statistics:** Paired sign test with BH-FDR; smallest achievable p-value is 0.25 for n = 3 paired tests
- **§11.7 gate:** Sinkhorn-Knopp calibration of the transition matrix; TV drift must be < 0.10
